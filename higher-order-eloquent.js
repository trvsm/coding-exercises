/*
Chapter 5: Higher Order Functions
repeat something n times:
function repeat(n, action){
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++){
        action(i);
    }
}
Higher order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values
The goal is more logical code that breaks to small chunks, easy to understand
