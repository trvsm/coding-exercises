Chapter 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

Square bracket notation: square brackets immediately following an expression with an expression inside looks up the element in left hand expression matching the index given by the expression in brackets
Dot notation: the word following dot is name of property to look up.  vs square brackets where the expression is evaluated, then converted to string
-Dot notation works only with properties that look like variable names, thus to access property "some property" use bracket notation: array["some property"]
Methods: a property that holds a function as its value
Objects: collections of properties.  curly braces at the start of statement commence block of statement, otherwise the describe an object

<in>: a binary operater. applied to string and object tells if that object has a property by that name
Object.assign: copies all properties from one object into another

<for-of> loop: works for arrays, strings, some others
